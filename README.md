# rainbow-highlight
This is a Lisp script for Emacs that enables you to highlight any snippet of text in an awesome way.

Just copy the script from rainbow-highlight.el into your Emacs init file (or any other bit of nerdery of your choiceâ€”whether thatâ€™s require, include, or whatever way you prefer to load external files).

â€¦then just highlight any word or text and hit C-c r ðŸ’¥ðŸŒˆ
